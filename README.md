# OnlineShopping
Online shopping website sells items. Each item has their own name, image URL, description, inventory (items left), price (in ETH and membership points), and membership points gained per item purchased. Each item is looked up using their unique SKU.

As mentioned above, there is a membership system in place. With the purchase of every item, a certain amount of points are earned. Each user can later use their points balance to redeem items.

For the shop administrator, there are functions in place that allow them to add, disable, and edit items, as well as a dedicated restock function. They also need a way to withdraw Ether.

For shoppers, there is a function for them to purchase an item. No refunds are available.
